## 4.3.1 Cyber Security Risk Assessment

### Overview
A detailed security risk assessment was conducted on Truelecâ€™s network using available resources. The results identified multiple critical assets, threats, and vulnerabilities according to their risk levels.

**Key Finding:**  
The **database** received the highest risk rating due to high business impact, potential unauthorized access, and software vulnerabilities. Data breaches could cause significant financial and reputational damage.
