# 4.4 Ethical and Social Issues

## Data Privacy and Security Concerns

According to Truelec’s operational structure — where client data management, project coordination, and a wide range of sensitive information are involved — the organization must ensure all resources are kept safe and secure. This includes personally identifiable information (PII) such as customer names and contact details used for project site updates.  
Truelec has an **ethical and social responsibility** to ensure that data is:
- Collected lawfully  
- Stored securely  
- Processed only for legitimate business purposes  

A key ethical issue relates to **data ownership**. Therefore, ethical data management practices must include obtaining informed consent from customers, encrypting stored data, and maintaining security especially when using **third-party cloud services** such as Azure or AWS.

## Potential Risks and Vulnerabilities

Truelec’s organizational architecture is exposed to several vulnerabilities, including:
- Weak access control mechanisms  
- Misconfigured cloud storage  
- Insecure wireless communication  

For example, a misconfigured network could lead to **data breaches** due to poor security arrangements.  
Social implications include **loss of customer trust**, **financial damage**, and **reputational harm**.  
To mitigate these risks, it is essential to:
- Strengthen network and access controls  
- Conduct regular audits  
- Implement strong encryption and monitoring policies

## Legal and Regulatory Framework

Truelec operates within Australia and must comply with the **Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)**, which governs how personal information is collected, stored, and used.  
The organization must ensure:
- Lawful collection of personal information  
- Protection against misuse or unauthorized access  

If Truelec handles data from clients in other regions (e.g., Europe), it must also consider compliance with the **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)** and apply stricter data-security measures accordingly.
